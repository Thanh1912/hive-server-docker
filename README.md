# hive-server-docker
Hive server using Docker Compose

Run the following command to start the Hive server:
`docker-compose up`
This will start both the Hive server and the PostgreSQL metastore, and expose the Hive server on port 10000. You can now connect to the server using a client such as Beeline or Hue.
